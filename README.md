# Dockerfile-hackpad
The mysql-connector-java-3.1.14-bin.jar is downloaded from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/3.1.html , if you don't trust it, you can download from official website and replace it.


All environment variables were written in Dockerfile -- overwrite it when run docker container if you need.


The fastest way to use -- use docker-compose, you can get docker-compose.yml at http://pastebin.com/6V31bs2p
